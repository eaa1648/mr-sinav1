# Clinical App Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the fixes made to resolve import issues in the clinical app modules.

## Issues Identified

1. Missing Python libraries in the virtual environment:
   - streamlit
   - pandas
   - plotly
   - scikit-learn
   - xgboost

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Activated Virtual Environment
The project uses a virtual environment located at `venv/`. All package installations were done within this environment.

### 2. Installed Missing Packages
The following packages were installed using pip:
```bash
pip install streamlit pandas plotly scikit-learn xgboost
```

### 3. Verified Imports
Created and ran a test script to verify that all clinical app modules can be imported successfully:
- ilac.py
- hasta_gidisat.py
- analiz_raporlama.py
- klinik_app.py
- model_egitimi.py
- veri_hazirla.py

## Package Versions Installed

- streamlit: 1.49.1
- pandas: 2.3.2
- plotly: 6.3.0
- scikit-learn: 1.7.2
- xgboost: 3.0.5

## Testing Results

All clinical app modules now import successfully without errors. The warnings shown during testing are related to Streamlit's runtime context and can be ignored when running import tests outside of the Streamlit environment.

## Running the Clinical Apps

To run any of the clinical apps, use the Streamlit command:

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment first
source venv/bin/activate

# Run any of the clinical apps
streamlit run clinical_app/ilac.py
streamlit run clinical_app/hasta_gidisat.py
streamlit run clinical_app/analiz_raporlama.py
streamlit run clinical_app/klinik_app.py
```

## Future Considerations

1. Consider updating the project's requirements.txt file to include all necessary dependencies
2. Document the virtual environment setup process for new developers
3. Create a setup script to automate the environment setup process
