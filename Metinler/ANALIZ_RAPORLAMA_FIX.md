# Analiz Raporlama Module Fix Summary

This document explains the fixes applied to resolve import issues in the `analiz_raporlama.py` file.

## Issues Identified

The pyright static analysis tool was reporting that several imports could not be resolved:
- `streamlit`
- `pandas`
- `plotly.graph_objects`
- `plotly.figure_factory`
- `plotly.express`

## Root Causes

1. **Incorrect Virtual Environment Path in pyright Configuration**: The `pyrightconfig.json` file was pointing to a different virtual environment path than the one actually being used.

2. **Static Analysis vs Runtime Environment Mismatch**: The packages were installed in the project's virtual environment, but pyright wasn't configured to look in the correct location.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated pyright Configuration
Modified `/Users/efeataakan/Desktop/mrv1/mr-sina/python_services/pyrightconfig.json` to point to the correct virtual environment:
```json
{
  "venvPath": ".",
  "venv": "venv",
  "executionEnvironments": [
    {
      "extraPaths": [
        "./venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Verified Package Installation
Confirmed that all required packages are installed in the virtual environment:
- streamlit>=1.28.0
- pandas>=1.5.0
- plotly>=5.18.0
- scikit-learn>=1.3.0
- xgboost>=2.0.0

### 3. Created Installation Script
Created `install_clinical_deps.py` to automate dependency installation for clinical apps.

### 4. Verified Imports
Created and ran a test script to confirm that `analiz_raporlama.py` can be imported successfully.

## Testing Results

All imports now work correctly:
- ✅ `streamlit` imports successfully
- ✅ `pandas` imports successfully
- ✅ `plotly.graph_objects` imports successfully
- ✅ `plotly.figure_factory` imports successfully
- ✅ `plotly.express` imports successfully

## How to Verify the Fix

1. **Check pyright configuration**: Ensure `pyrightconfig.json` points to the correct virtual environment
2. **Verify package installation**: Run `pip list` in the activated virtual environment
3. **Test imports**: Run the test script to verify imports work correctly

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /Users/efeataakan/Desktop/mrv1/mr-sina/python_services

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run the test
cd clinical_app
python3 test_analiz_raporlama.py
```

## Running the Application

To run the analiz_raporlama application:

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /Users/efeataakan/Desktop/mrv1/mr-sina/python_services

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run the application
streamlit run clinical_app/analiz_raporlama.py
```

## Future Considerations

1. **Keep pyright configuration up to date** when changing virtual environments
2. **Regularly verify package installations** especially after system updates
3. **Document dependency versions** to ensure consistency across environments
